# Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?

## Background

Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: _"Duh. It gets hotter..."_

But, if pressed, how would you **prove** it?

### Analysis
* Temperature seems to have a clear correlation with latitude\n",
* As expected, the weather becomes significantly warmer as one approaches the equator (0 Deg. Latitude). The southern hemisphere tends to be warmer this time of year than the northern hemisphere\n",
* There is no strong relationship between latitude and cloudiness. However, it is interesting to see that a strong band of cities near 0, 80, and 90% cloudiness\n",
* There is no strong relationship between latitude and wind speed. However, in northern hemispheres there is a flurry of cities with over 20 mph of wind\n",
* Wind speed tends to generally be betweeen 0 and 15 mph regardless of latitude\n",
* There is no strong relationship between latitude and humidity. however there is a slightly larger cluster of northern hemisphere cities with high humidity (above 60% humidity)"
